# TypeScript Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument, resulting in a compilation error.

The solution involves ensuring that the arguments passed to the function match the expected types.
